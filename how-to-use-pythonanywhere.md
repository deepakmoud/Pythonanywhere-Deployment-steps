#### 1. Signup
   
**a.** Go to PythonAnywhere website at https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ and click on **Pricing & signup**.

![Signup](images/1-sign-up-1.png)

**b.** Click **Create a Beginner account** , then provide your details to get your account created.

**c.** You will see a Warning to confirm you email. Confirm your email, login again and the Warning disappears.

You will see the PythonAnywhere Dashboard giving you a summary.

#### 2. Prepare the environment
To open the Bash console, on the Dashboard page under Consoles, under New console click **$ Bash**. This will open the bash console on the underlying linux machine.
 
 
 
 Step 2 :
Click on Recent Consoles

Uploading your code to PythonAnywhere
Assuming your code is already on a code sharing site like GitHub or Bitbucket, you can just clone it from a Bash Console:



# for example
$ git clone https://github.com/myusername/myproject.git

**a.** Many of the popular python libraries are pre-installed. You can check that by opening the Bash console. 

To open the Bash console, on the Dashboard page under Consoles, under New console click **$ Bash**. This will open the bash console on the underlying linux machine.

**b.** Type the command ```pip list``` to see the pre-installed python packages and their versions.

or

**c.** For the Machine Learning Zoomcamp course Week#5, it is required to install scikit-learn version 1.0 and hence, you will need to upgrade the existing scikit-learn package.
    
*Note: PythonAnywhere also allows creating virtual environments, however when I tried using that and installed all the required packages in it, it was consuming some 380 MB of file space out of max 512 MB available for free account. Hence I do not recommend using that at the moment*
    
While in the Bash console, use the command ```pip install --upgrade scikit-learn==1.0```

The upgraded packages roughly takes some 110+ MB

#### 3. Create/Deploy your Web App
 
**a.** Now you can create your Webapp (The free account allows deploying a single webapp). Click on **Web**, then click **+ Add a new web app**

![Create webapp](images/10-web-app-2.png)
    
![Create webapp](images/11-web-app-3.png)
    
**b.** Select **Flask**
    
![Create webapp](images/12-web-app-4.png)
    
**c.** Then, select **Python 3.8**
    
![Create webapp](images/13-web-app-5.png)
    
**d.** You can now accept the default path and filename for the python code for flask app (I chose default), or you can provide details as per your preference.
    
![Create webapp](images/14-web-app-6.png)

You need to change path
    
**e.** Your web app is now deployed and active (with a default code). For the free account, to keep your web app active, you need to click the **Run until 3 months from today** atleast once before the 3 months expire.
   
Make a note of the URL for your web app (this is typically https://yourid.pythonanywhere.com)
    
![Create webapp](images/15-web-app-7.png)
    
**f.** Test the sample web app (with the default code). Open a tab in your browser and paste your web app URL
   
![Default webapp](images/16-web-app-8.png)
   
To view/edit the default code, go to Files and navigate to the appropriate file in the path (if you chose the default then it is mysite/flask_app.py)
   
![Default webapp code step1](images/17-web-app-9.png)
   
![Default webapp code step2](images/18-web-app-10.png)
   
![Default webapp code step3](images/19-web-app-11.png)
   
**g.** Now edit the default code and update it with appropriate code for your task, click on **Save**.
 
![Custom webapp code](images/20-web-app-13.png)
 
**h.** Click ![reload](images/21-reload-web-app-14.png) to reload the web app from the code you updated and saved.

#### 4. Upload ML model files (if/as applicable)

Upload any ML model files (e.g. the dv.bin for the DictVectorizer and model1.bin for the LogisticRegression trained model - as per homework for ML )

Click on **Files**, go to the path where the python code for ther web has been deployed (in this example - mysite), click **Upload a file** and upload your model file(s) as applicable.

![Upload model files](images/9-upload-model-files.png)

#### 5. Test your Web App
 
You can now test whether your Web App is running successfully (now being hosted on PythonAnywhere). From your local machine (or from anywhere, where you have python installed, requests package installed and having internet access) execute the code to test your Web App.
 
Below is sample test scenario for the homework of Week5 of ML Zoomcamp course.
